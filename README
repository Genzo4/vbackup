Simple Backup
=============

This is a collection of scripts that perform backup to systems.
It should support most of the unices out there (everything different should be
reported as a bug).

This version of sbackup can backup:

    * Postgresql databases
    * MySQL databases
    * Filesystems using GNU tar
    * XFS filesystems using xfsdump

The backup procedure is completely customizable and extendable by the user.

Requirements:
=============

 * GNU tar - for the tar method
 * xfsdump - for the xfsdump method

Installation:
=============

# ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc
# make
# make install

This will install sbackup to /usr/local and assume the configuration files will
be placed at /etc/sbackup

Usage:
======

For usage run:
# sbackup --help

For a list of backup methods (scripts) run:
# sbackup --list

To get some information about a module run:
# sbackup --help <module>

example:
# sbackup --help xfsdump

Setup:
======

Let's assume you want to
    * Backup to an NFS mounted space
    * Perform backup of two partitions using xfsdump (full and incremental)
    * Perform backup of directories using tar (full and incremantal)
    * Perform mysql and pgsql backup

1.  Go to /etc/sbackup and create a folder named rc.d. This will hold all the
    configuration scripts.
2.  Copy from the samples directory ($prefix/share/sbackup/samples) the
    following scripts to rc.d:
    * sample.nfsmount
    * sample.umount
    * sample.xfsdump
    * sample.mysql
    * sample.pgsql
    * sample.umount

3.  Rename sample.nfsmount to remote.nfsmount. (Any name with the extension
    .nfsmount will do) and edit it. Change the values of the variables to fit
    your needs.
4.  Rename sample.umount to remote.umount and edit it. Just set the mountpoint
    to umount.
5.  Rename sample.mysql to full.mysql and edit it. Read the note at the top of
    the script and set variables as needed.
6.  Rename sample.pgsql to full.pgsql and edit it.
7.  Copy sample.tar to level0.tar an edit it. Set the level to 0
8.  Rename sample.tar to level5.tar and edit it. Set the level to 5
9.  Copy sample.xfsdump to level0.xfsdump and edit it. Set the level to 0
10. Rename xfsdump to level5.xfsdump and edit it. Set the level to 5

11. Create two directories named backup.0 and backup.5 under /etc/sbackup
12. Enter backup.0 and create softlinks to the desired configuration files:
    # ln -s ../rc.d/remote.nfsmount 00-remote.nfsmount
    # ln -s ../rc.d/remote.umount 99-remote.umount
    # ln -s ../rc.d/full.mysql 10-full.mysql
    # ln -s ../rc.d/full.pgsql 10-full.pgsql
    # ln -s ../rc.d/level0.tar 20-level0.tar
    # ln -s ../rc.d/level0.xfsdump 30-level0.xfsdump
13. Enter backup.1 and create softlinks:
    # ln -s ../rc.d/remote.nfsmount 00-remote.nfsmount
    # ln -s ../rc.d/remote.umount 99-remote.umount
    # ln -s ../rc.d/level5.tar 20-level5.tar
    # ln -s ../rc.d/level5.xfsdump 30-level5.xfsdump
14. Check the configuration using:
    # sbackup --check 0
    # sbackup --check 5

To perform level 0 backup run
# sbackup 0

To perform level 5 backup run
# sbackup 5

How it works:
=============

When you run:
# sbackup 0

The script enters directory /etc/sbackup/backup.0 and searches for files named
XX-name.module, where <XX> is a number and <module> is a backup module/method.
All configurations are examined in an alphabetical order, so that the <XX>
prefix may be used to indicate the order. For each configuration file,
coresponding module (<module>) is executed using the configuration file
options. A module may be used from zero to many times.

This way you'll have to create configuration files once and perform various
types of backups, depending on your needs.

The verbosity of the backup procedure may be controlled using the -d parameter.
Level 7 is recomended.

Available modules:
==================

Extending:
==========

    If you're interested in extending sbackup, just read the README.dev and
    have a look at the existing modules (I recomend mount and tar/xfsdump).
    A template for new modules is available with the name 'skel' under the
    scripts/ directory of the source code.

    If you believe you've created something that will be usefull for others
    too, I'll be glad to include it in the distribution (preserving your
    copyright of course)
