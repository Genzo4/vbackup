# The local directory to be copied to remote system
# This can be used in two ways:
# 1) A relative path is set: This is interpreted as being relative to
#    DESTDIR0. This can be used in a backup strategy where, after creating
#    the backup, all data are copied to a remote host.
# 2) An absoulte path is set: This is the simple case of copying something
#    to a remote host.
#
# If this is empty then then DESTDIR0 is used by itself
#
# Default: empty
SOURCE=""

# The remote host to copy data to (required)
RHOST=""

# The remote path to copy data to (required)
#
# The full path is RPREFIX/RDIR
#
# The RPREFIX must exist.
# The RDIR will be created if it doesn't exist.
# RDIR must only contain one level to be created. For example, if RDIR is
# a/b/c and only a/ exists, then it will faile. However, if a/b exists then
# it will succeed. This happens because of scp.
# Default for RDIR: "%D1-%L%"
RPREFIX=""
# RDIR="%D1%-%L%/"

# The username to use for scp (required)
USERNAME=""

# Extra parameters to be passed to scp (optional)
# WARNING: no spaces !
# SCPEXTRA=""
