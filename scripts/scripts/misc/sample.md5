# To verify the MD5s using the defaults just cd to the backup directory

#   md5sum -c md5sums

# The directory to create md5sums of
# All files under this directory will be processed
# The directory is relative to DESTDIR0 meaining that if SOURCE is empty
# or / then the whole DESTDIR0 will be processed. This is the default
# and a sane option
SOURCE=""

# The file to store the md5sums. This is relative to DESTDIR0.
