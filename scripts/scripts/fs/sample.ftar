# The directories to backup (required)
# This can be either a space separated list of directories (DIRS)
# or a file with a directory on each line (DIRFILE)
# Exaclty one of DIRS/DIRFILE is required
#DIRS="/etc /usr/local"
#DIRFILE="/etc/backup"

# A space separated list of regular expressions that match files which should
# be excluded from the backup. They will be checked against the whole path
# starting from the DIRS entries. For example, when dumping /usr, the regexp
# will be checked against share/ local/ local/sbin/ local/bin/ etc.
# No '^' or '$' will be added, so you should probably add one yourself.
# When excluding directories you should not use ^XX$ because this will only
# exclulde the directory. (optional)
#EXCLUDE="^/tmp"

# A file containing one regular expression per line, as specified above
# that indicate files to be excluded from the backup
#EXCLUDEFILE="/etc/backup.exclude"

# A path to hold last backup dates. This directory should be
# persistent for incremental backups to work (required)
STATEDIR="/var/lib/vbackup/state/ftar"

# The destination directory (required)
DESTDIR="fs/"

# The name to give to the root filesystem tar file
